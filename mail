- Kafka Broker:

10.56.21.251:7072

10.56.21.252:7073

- Kafka Connect:
10.56.21.32:7081

10.56.21.251:7082

10.56.21.252:7083

- ZooKeeper:

10.56.21.251:7092

These endpoints are accessible and ready to be scraped by your Prometheus server. Let us know if you need sample scrape configs or help validating the connectivity.
