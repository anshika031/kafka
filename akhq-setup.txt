1. kafka server- (RUN INSIDE FAKFA FOLDER)

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Windows\System32\wbem
bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties

2. zookeeper- (RUN INSIDE KAFKA FOLDER)
bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties

3. akhq- (Java 17 mandatory) (RUN INSIDE AKHQ FOLDER)
a)
Download the JAR : 
wget https://github.com/tchiotludo/akhq/releases/download/v0.25.1/akhq-0.25.1-all.jar

b)
1. Create a yml file
2. Run any one of the following commands: 
 
java -jar akhq-0.25.1-all.jar server --config C:\akhq\application.yml  (it will run in 8080 port)
java -Dmicronaut.config.files=application.yml -jar akhq-0.25.1-all.jar

4. check whether all ports are running-
for 9092: netstat -ano | findstr :9092
for 8080: netstat -ano | findstr :8080

5. list topics-
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server 10.10.1.83:9092 --list

6.create topics-
kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-topic --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1

7. how many msgs are being sent to topic-
kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic user-topic --from-beginning
(The command kafka-console-consumer.bat --from-beginning reads messages directly from Kafka’s topic, not based on whether your Spring Boot consumer successfully processed them.)


For Knowledge Purpose-
Key Points:
✔ Producers send messages to Kafka topics.
✔ Kafka stores the messages (even if no consumer is available).
✔ Consumers pull messages from topics at their own pace.
✔ A failed consumer doesn’t affect message storage — Kafka keeps them until they expire or are deleted.

NOTE :- The consumer received them but failed during processing , means?

1- What Does "Consumer Received the Message" Mean?
It means that Kafka successfully delivered the message to your consumer and the method annotated with @KafkaListener was triggered.
The method started execution (confirmed because the method got hit) but processing failed at some point, so the method didn’t complete. 

2- "Received" means the consumer got the message from Kafka and started processing.
It does NOT mean the message was fully processed successfully.

3- If processing fails , the message might:
a: Be retried (if retries are configured).
b: Go to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) (if configured).
c: Stay unprocessed if offset commits are manual and not committed.
